# FluxTowers
Exploring the climate and soils of eddy covariance towers and their proximity to one another.

Towers.csv is a database of eddy covariance tower locations and associated environmental variables. Climate data from databases was obtained from WorldClim 2.1 (Fick and Hijmans, 2017, https://doi.org/10.1002/joc.5086. Soils data were obtained from the top 0-5 cm depths from the SoilGrid 2.0 database (Poggio et al., 2021, https://doi.org/10.5194/soil-7-217-2021). MAT = mean annual temperature. MAP = mean annual precipitation. SRAD = solar radiation. bdod = bulk density. cec = cation exchange capacity. N = soil nitrogen content. pH = soil pH. soc = soil organic carbon content.

RandomPoints is a sample of the edaphic characteristics of 10000 random locations from [SoilGrids250m 2.0](https://soilgrids.org/)

RandomSoilDepth is a sample of soil and sedimentary deposit thickness from [Pellitier et al. 2016](https://daac.ornl.gov/SOILS/guides/Global_Soil_Regolith_Sediment.html).
